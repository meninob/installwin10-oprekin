# installwin10-oprekin


So, after researching on the Laptop I have, I bought this M.2 2242 SSD drive for 3 quid at CEX in Stratford UK, and then installed it, and it works quite fast, but what could I do with just 16gb ssd drive?
Initially I thought of installing a linux distro on it, but I already have linux mint on it, so whats the point in having 2 linux distro's on one laptop.
So thought of windows, but windows needs more than 16gn ram, and after reasearching, found superlite windows 10, and Oprekin Windows 10. tried superlite, but had issues on space.
Tried Oprekin, and works quite fast, wthout all the features, but required features are there - powershell, windows, and the basics. + is superfast.


In order to install any M.2 SATA drive on Lenovo T440P and I think works with other laptops, download the intel RAID drivers (RST storage; can also get it from DELL)
The filename is iaStorVD.inf, .sys and .cat or iaAHCIC.inf, .sys and .cat.

This should be used when selecting the driver during windows install, and then it will be able to detect the drive, after loading this driver.
